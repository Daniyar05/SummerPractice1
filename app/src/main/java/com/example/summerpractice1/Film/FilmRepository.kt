                    "Darabont acquired the film rights in 1987, but development did not begin until five years later, when he wrote the script in eight weeks. Two weeks after submitting his script to Castle Rock Entertainment, Darabont received a \$25 million budget for the film's production, which began in January 1993. While the film is set in Maine , filming took place from June to August 1993 almost entirely in Mansfield, Ohio , with the Mansfield Penitentiary serving as the penitentiary of the same name. The project attracted many stars of the time for the role of Andy, including Tom Hanks , Tom Cruise and Kevin Costner . The film's music was composed by Thomas Newman .\n" +

                    "The film received critical acclaim, especially for its plot and the performances of Robbins and Freeman, but was a box office failure, earning only \$16 million during its initial release. Many reasons for its failure have been cited, including competition from films such as Pulp Fiction and Forrest Gump , the general unpopularity of prison films , the lack of female characters, and even the title, which was considered confusing to audiences. It received several nominations, including seven Academy Award nominations and a re-release that, combined with international screenings, increased its box office gross to \$73.3 million.\n" +
